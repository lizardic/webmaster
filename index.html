                                    This is a popular IDE (integrated development environment) for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I use. It would be easiest to follow
                                    my instructions using this, but you can choose to use a different IDE. Download it using the button below

                                    Create a folder system similar to the one shown below. I will refer to these folders when telling you where to place files.

                                    First, open Brackets on computer. Then, click <strong>File->New</strong> twice to open up two files. After, click <strong>File->Save As...</strong> on each file to save the files. Save one of them as (htmlFileName).html and the other as (cssFileName).css. Place the
                                    HTML file in (Website Name) and place the CSS file in (Website Name)/myFiles/css

                        - The link tag is used to link other files, which can be connected by supplying rel, href, and possibly type attributes <br>
                        - In this example, CSS styles, normalize.css, the fluid grid, and google fonts are linked, in that order. <br>
                        - Lastly, the head contains the title of the website.

                            - The body contains the elements that people generally associate with webpages <br>
                            - These elements are either on the home page (header) or later pages (section) <br>
                            - Sections can be given class names which can be referred to when styling the section <br>
                            - I use div class="row" and div class="column" to break my website into rows and columns for easy formatting. You can place any HTML elements that you could place in the header in these rows, columns, or elsewhere in the section to build webpages after your main home page (the header).  <br>
                            - The line after the closing body tag allows you to easily use ionicons by copy pasting the code given on the ionicons website that resembles the form (ion-icon name="name of icon").

                            - h1 is generally a main heading, and h6 is generally the sub-most heading <br>
                            - Paragraphs can be created using an opening and closing p tag. <br>
                            - Links and buttons that function as links can be created with an a tag and href attribute, where the href attribute contains the link name<br>
                            - You can also add a target attribute with value "_blank" to make the link open in a new tab <br>
                            - You can also use a class attribute with the a tag or any other tag to assign an element to a class <br>
                            - Images are made with an img tag and src attribute, where the src attribute contains the file name <br>
                            - You can also use an alt attribute to give an alternative description in case the photo cannot be displayed <br>
                            - You can create a container using the div tag that is referenced through the class name in the class attribute <br>
                            - These will be used in a similar way to header, section, or class names since it a container holds a group of HTML elements that are similar in some way </p>

                            - We use div class="row" because that creates a row to place elements inside <br>
                            - Inside the row, we placed an unordered list that has list items that are links <br>
                            - # is simply a placeholder, you should put the link name in the href attribute <br>
                            <br>
                            Important Note: Using container div with class="row" can create a row. Then, you can use container div again with class="column" to create columns within your row to, for example, split a row of your webpage into 3 columns.

                            <p>
                                Choose fonts that are very neutral and plain, without little fancy extensions coming out of the letters, such as san-serif fonts. Some examples are Open Sans, Lato, Raleway, Monsterrat, and PT Sans. Use very big fonts with decreased font weights for headings and small fonts with increased line height for paragraphs.

                                Pick one/two main color(s) to use in a way similar to how I used red/pink on this site, otherwise use mostly black and white. It prevents the website from looking like the website on the left. Use color to draw attention to important elements of the website.

                        In CSS you will style the HTML elements you have already created, and the box model is important for understanding how to style elements.
                        In the center of an HTML element is the content (like text, for example). Then, there is padding between the content and the element's border. Finally, there is a margin consisting of whitespace surrounding the border. The size of these parts can adjusted to your liking for each element.

                    <h3>Structure of CSS Rule</h3>
                    <p>
                        In CSS, a grouping of code is often referred to as a rule. A rule consists of a selector and properties. The selector can be a type of HTML element, a container, or a class. The defining factor of a selector is that it allows the user to reference 1 or more HTML element so that the element(s) can be styled. The properties in a rule are statements that affect the display of the HTML element(s) referenced by the selector.

                    <h3>Formatting Sections, Rows, and Columns</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are some examples of how I format the sections, rows, and columns I create in HTML. Note that the elements within these rows and columns can now be given widths and heights to occupy 0%-100% of the space provided by your HTML structure, as shown on the bottom.

                        Below are types of selectors you can use. Of course, I cannot be specific and list every example, so I speak generally in my comments on the code below. If you would like to see more selectors, click the link to the HTML documentation.

                    <h3>Inspect-Observing Other Websites</h3>
                    <p>
                        On Google Chrome, you can right-click on any element on any website and click Inspect. After doing this, an interface will pop up with heading "Elements" in one navigation bar and heading "Styles" in another. Study the code under "Elements" for the HTML behind the website and "Styles" for the CSS. You'll notice that as you hover code, certain elements highlight on the webpage, meaning you are viewing the code that created the element. You can get ideas from any website, even mine. This is important for inspiration, as there is no need to figure out how to create the most beautiful website when so many other people have already attempted to and you can learn from them.
